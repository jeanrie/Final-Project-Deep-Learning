## Energy Consumption Prediction Using LSTM Models

This project involves predicting energy consumption of household appliances using three types of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models: Vanilla LSTM, Bidirectional LSTM, and Stacked LSTM. These models are trained to analyze time-series data to forecast future energy usage, enabling better energy management and optimization.


## Introduction
Efficient energy management is critical for reducing costs and optimizing appliance usage in households. This project utilizes three types of LSTM models, which are well-suited for time-series forecasting, to predict the energy consumption of various household appliances.


## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the REFIT dataset, which contains time-series data of household energy consumption. Collection of this dataset was supported by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) via the project entitled Personalised Retrofit Decision Support Tools for UK Homes using Smart Home Technology (REFIT), which is a collaboration among the Universities of Strathclyde, Loughborough and East Anglia. The dataset includes data from 20 households from the Loughborough area over the period 2013 - 2015. Additional information about REFIT is available from www.refitsmarthomes.org.



## Results
The project includes evaluation metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) to assess the performance of each model. The predicted energy consumption values can be visualized using time-series plots for better understanding and analysis.
