## Energy Consumption Prediction Model Deployment

This repository contains code and instructions to deploy energy consumption prediction models using Streamlit. The models used include Vanilla LSTM, Stacked LSTM, and Bidirectional LSTM, all trained on the REFIT dataset.


## Overview
This project aims to predict the energy consumption of household appliances using multiple LSTM models. The predictions are aggregated to provide a comprehensive overview of energy usage and estimated costs.


## Models
The following LSTM models are used for energy consumption prediction:

Vanilla LSTM: A simple LSTM model with a single layer.
Stacked LSTM: An LSTM model with multiple layers to capture more complex patterns.
Bidirectional LSTM: An LSTM model that processes data in both forward and backward directions to capture context from both past and future states.
