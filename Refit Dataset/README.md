## REFIT

The REFIT electrical load measurements dataset comprises nine individual appliance measurements at 8-second intervals per house as well as whole house aggregate loads that were continually gathered from 20 households over a two-year period. The dataset includes the greatest number of houses in the UK that have been tracked for longer than a year at the time of publication. With 1,194,958,790 measurements in the dataset, more over 250,000 tracked appliance uses are represented. The data is clear, time-stamped, and easily comma-separated, removing erroneous measurements, accurately labeling appliance data, and filling in minor gaps in missing data.
